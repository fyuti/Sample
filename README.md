# Profile Card

This is a simple, accessible **Profile Card** component built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It displays a user profile, including name, bio, avatar, social links, hobbies, dislikes, and a live time in milliseconds. The card is responsive and adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Stacks content vertically on smaller screens and displays it side-by-side on larger screens.
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses semantic tags (`<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, etc.) for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Accessible**: Each element has a `data-testid` attribute for easy automated testing.
- **Social Links**: Displays social media links with the ability to open in new tabs.
- **Dynamic Time**: Shows the current time in milliseconds (`Date.now()`).
- **Image Support**: Displays a userâ€™s avatar image.
